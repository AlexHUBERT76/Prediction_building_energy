# Prediction_building_energy
Data analysis and prediction of energy consumption and greenhouse gases emissions from a dataset of buildings


Predict the energy consumption of buildings


Using the 2016 Building energy benchmarking of Seattle (https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/2016-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/2bpz-gwpy) 
dataset (File : https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/course.oc-static.com/projects/Data_Scientist_P4/2016_Building_Energy_Benchmarking.csv), 
we try here to model the energy consumption and greenhouse gases emition for future bulding from their surface, use and location. 
We will also evaluate if the energystar score, which is dificult to obtain, is a relevant metric that can help us build the model.
